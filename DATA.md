# Data Analysis

The data analysis has been performed in 4 stages and these analysis are visible on the following jupyter notebooks

* Notebooks with visualizations
    * [Linear Regression](linear_regression.ipynb)
    * [Clustering](Clustering.ipynb)
* Other Notebooks
    * [Initial Exploration](initial_exploration)
    * [Classification](Classification.ipynb)
    

The exploration began with [Initial Exploration](initial_exploration) which has been documented in the notebook. The data was pretty robust with 2991 Rows and 9 Columns. It consisted the Daily Data of bitcoin from 2013 to 2021. Some numeric Features of the data include the prices opening, closing, low, high, volume and market cap and I figured that it would be pretty interesting to try to predict the high price of bitcoin based on the opening price.
