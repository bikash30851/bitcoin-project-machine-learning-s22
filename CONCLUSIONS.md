# Narrative Conclusion


The project started with a goal of predicting the high price of the currency based upon the opening price. It can be inferred from the metrics that whenever there is a high opening price the high price of the currency for the day will go up with respect to the opening price. This conclusion is based upon the high fit accuracy of the models employed and visualizations of the [regression](linear_regression.ipynb), [clustering](Clustering.ipynb) and outputs of other models present in this repository. 

While critics can argue that the change in high price might not be solely because of the change in opening price therefore, a PCA analysis can be performed in order to determine the varibale that is contributing the most towards the change. 

The metrics and technical explainations are present [here](ANALYSIS.md).
