# Bitcoin.csv raw data acquisition and analysis

I started my search for data on `Kaggle` and obtained two sources of data. They are listed below. 

* [All Crypto](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessevent/all-crypto-currencies)
* [Cryptocurrency Price History](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)

Here is the dataset that I extracted from above sources.
